# FakeDeafen

A port of the original **"Fake Deafen"** plugin, now for **Vencord**.  
Originally made for BetterDiscord in 2022, this plugin lets you **appear deafened in a voice channel** while still being able to hear and speak.

---

## Description

FakeDeafen works by intercepting Discord’s voice state messages.  
- **Others will see you as deafened**, but you can still speak and hear normally.  
- Controlled automatically—no extra commands are required.  

---

## Instructions

1. Join the voice channel you want to use FakeDeafen in.  
2. **Deafen yourself manually** before enabling the plugin.  
3. Enable the plugin.  
4. Click the **Undeafen** button.  

You are now **fake-deafened**: others see you as deafened, but you maintain full voice capabilities.

## Restarting

To restart FakeDeafen:  
1. Disable the plugin.  
2. Restart your Discord client.

## Notes

- Designed for **custom-built Vencord instances only**.  
- Simple port from the original BetterDiscord version.  
- Future updates may add more features.
